# Currency_Converter_-UI-Mockup-.JS


This is a front-end UI design of a currency converter built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focuses on the visual appearance and layout of a typical currency conversion tool, including dropdowns for currency selection and input fields for amount display. While it does not perform real-time conversions, it serves as a clean and modern interface that can be integrated with APIs in the future.
